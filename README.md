# OOP(object oriented programing)

- OOP has some fundamentals concept that you need to analyse on a given problem description.-in order to successfull model a problem domain you need to know this fundamentals, that is `class`,`object`,and `state` 


- Here is how you could model a rock,paper,scissors game using OOP given a problem description

## Problem description

Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by two participants. The game consists of rounds. In each round, a participant chooses a symbol from rock, paper, or scissors, and the other participant does the same. Then a winner of the round is determined by comparing the chosen symbols. The rules of the game state that rock wins over scissors, scissors beats (cuts) paper, and paper beats (covers) rock. The winner of the round is awarded a point. The game goes on for as many rounds as the participants agree on. The winner is the participant with the most points.
